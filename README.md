# Are swimming pool resources in NYC equitably distributed?

This repo includes analysis of the following datasets:
- NYC Parks Pools Map, to access geographic locations of the pools as polygons
- The Heat Vulnerability Index published on the Environment and Health Data Portal, which classifies each Neighborhood Tabulation Area with a 1-5 score based on its vulnerability to heat, assessed through variables including green space, surface temperature and percentage of Black residents
- 2020 Neighborhood Tabulation Areas, to access geographic polygons of each NTA (needed to join with the Heat Vulnerability Index)
- Aquatics Programming: 2021 to Current by NYC Parks, which shows attendance and location information for NYC Parks' indoor and outdoor aquatics program "Learn To Swim."
- NYC Parks Outdoor Pools Session Information, which contains data on pool attendance and number of lifeguards during pool inspections
